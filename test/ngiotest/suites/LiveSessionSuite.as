/**
 * LiveSessionSuite
 *
 * Proves a session can be obtained at all, before anything depends on one.
 *
 * SPLIT: the Passport half lives in LiveSignInSuite, so LiveGuestSuite can run
 * between the two. A guest session only exists between "we have a session" and
 * "a user signed in", and a suite is the unit the runner schedules - the guest
 * tests could not sit in that window while both halves were one suite.
 *
 * Order is therefore:
 *
 *   Live / No session     parks any restored session, so it always runs
 *   Live / Session        this suite - a session appears
 *   Live / Guest session  parks any login, gets a real guest session, ends it
 *   Live / Sign-in        Passport attaches a user, or one is already attached
 *
 * Everything after that depends on being signed in.
 *
 * EACH SUITE MAKES THE STATE IT TESTS. That is what lets a single run cover all
 * three session states on any machine, whatever the tester is logged into, with
 * no prompt and no state-dependent skips. App.endSession is covered by
 * LiveGuestSuite, on the throwaway guest session it created - not on the
 * tester's own login, which is why it no longer needs consent.
