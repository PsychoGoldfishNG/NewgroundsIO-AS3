/**
 * LiveNoSessionSuite
 *
 * Everything the gateway will do for a client that has NO session at all.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH HAVING. Sixteen of the twenty-five components never touch a
 * session, and games use them that way - a medal list or a high score table
 * shown on a title screen, before anyone has signed in. Nothing else in the
 * suite proves those calls work with no session_id in the envelope, because
 * every other live suite runs after the session exists.
 *
 * THIS SUITE MAKES ITS OWN WINDOW, so it runs on every machine in every login
 * state. setUp() parks whatever session AppState restored during construction
 * and tearDown() puts it back.
 *
 * That is honest rather than a shortcut: the request envelope is built from
 * appState.session.id (Core.sendRequest), so clearing it locally reproduces
 * exactly the wire condition being tested - a request with no session_id. No
 * session is ended, nothing is sent, and the tester's login is untouched.
 *
 * It used to rely on finding a naturally session-free window between init() and
 * the first checkSession(). That window does not exist for either common case -
 * a developer with a remembered login, or a game embedded on Newgrounds where
 * the page URL supplies ngio_session_id - so on exactly the machines people test
 * on the whole suite reported permanent skips, and the only way to run it was to
 * clear stored session state and start again.
 *
 * MUST RUN BEFORE anything loads medals while signed in. Its unlock test asserts
 * the medal is not flagged unlocked, which only holds while the cache reflects a
 * sessionless read.
